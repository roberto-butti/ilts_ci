All clips and music belong to their respectfull owners. I do not earn any money with this video. This video is for enjoyment purposes only. Here is another lyrics video I made with Metallica. I just got the album today (as of 3/17/2007) and I felt like posting my favorite song from it on youtube! This only took me 2 hours to make :-) it was, honestly, a worthy 2 hours of my life. By the way, I understand the girl/phone joke. I know it was pretty ridiculous, but whatever. I know I wrote 'I'm bored' in the solo, but that didn't mean I got bored of the solo. I was expressing my current thoughts when I wrote that while I was making the video. You know, it's a bit of work :PI know I messed up on some of the lyrics, but it shouldn't matter too much. I can't go back to change those errors now, unless I want to delete the video with a good haul of views. I know that some of you don't like the quotes, and you'd rather have pictures instead. I put pictures at the beginning but I deleted them from my documents afterward so they got deleted. I got lazy right then and didn't want to find them again, so I did something a little different instead. I know that before the second solo, there is a \"Fix me!\" shout right before then that I forgot to put in. My bad, I didn't know what was being said there. I was looking at the booklet that came with the CD for lyrics, and it didn't show what was said there. If you want to, go ahead and shout out \u003cb\u003e...\u003c/b\u003e","tags":["Metallica","Master","Of","Puppets","With","Lyrics","James","Hetfield","Lars","Ulrich","Cliff","Burton","Kirk","Hammett","interpretation","Alexmarvick","Robert","Trujillo"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_z-hEyVQDRA/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_z-hEyVQDRA/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d_z-hEyVQDRA&feature\u003dyoutube_gdata_player"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/_z-hEyVQDRA?f\u003dvideos&app\u003dyoutube_gdata"},"duration":512,"recorded":"2007-03-17","geoCoordinates":{"latitude":47.56169891357422,"longitude":-122.1240234375},"rating":4.8660517,"likeCount":"97966","ratingCount":101360,"viewCount":31630836,"favoriteCount":78463,"commentCount":90735,"status":{"value":"restricted","reason":"limitedSyndication"},"restrictions":[{"type":"country","relationship":"deny","countries":"DE"}],"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"allowed","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"denied"}},{"id":"bAsA00-5KoI","uploaded":"2007-07-09T13:37:13.000Z","updated":"2011-08-30T18:07:57.000Z","uploader":"aSoul4U","category":"Music","title":"Metallica - Nothing Else Matters [Original Video]","description":"This is the original videoclip","tags":["Videoclip","Original","Video","Rock","Metalica"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAsA00-5KoI/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/bAsA00-5KoI/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dbAsA00-5KoI&feature\u003dyoutube_gdata_player"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/bAsA00-5KoI?f\u003dvideos&app\u003dyoutube_gdata"},"duration":394,"rating":4.9299192,"likeCount":"86387","ratingCount":87927,"viewCount":29653043,"favoriteCount":84224,"commentCount":24556,"status":{"value":"restricted","reason":"limitedSyndication"},"restrictions":[{"type":"country","relationship":"deny","countries":"DE"}],"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"allowed","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"denied"}},{"id":"98xNx87hRbU","uploaded":"2011-07-01T11:48:56.000Z","updated":"2011-08-30T05:07:53.000Z","uploader":"sonisphereuk","category":"Comedy","title":"Bill Bailey's message to Metallica","description":"Bill recorded this special message to Metallica during his rehearsals for Sonisphere UK at Knebworth!","tags":["metallica","bill bailey","sonisphere"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/98xNx87hRbU/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/98xNx87hRbU/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d98xNx87hRbU&feature\u003dyoutube_gdata_player","mobile":"http://m.youtube.com/details?v\u003d98xNx87hRbU"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/98xNx87hRbU?f\u003dvideos&app\u003dyoutube_gdata","1":"rtsp://v8.cache7.c.youtube.com/CiILENy73wIaGQm1ReHOx03M9xMYDSANFEgGUgZ2aWRlb3MM/0/0/0/video.3gp","6":"rtsp://v1.cache5.c.youtube.com/CiILENy73wIaGQm1ReHOx03M9xMYESARFEgGUgZ2aWRlb3MM/0/0/0/video.3gp"},"duration":77,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","rating":4.9665184,"likeCount":"7582","ratingCount":7646,"viewCount":714260,"favoriteCount":5032,"commentCount":924,"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"allowed"}},{"id":"fm8iU_1Erz4","uploaded":"2011-07-27T18:49:20.000Z","updated":"2011-08-29T22:11:46.000Z","uploader":"MetallicaTV","category":"Music","title":"Metallica - The Memory Remains (Live - Quebec City, Canada) - MetOnTour","description":"The Memory Remains from Quebec City, Canada.
